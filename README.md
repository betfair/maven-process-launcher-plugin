maven-test-process-plugin
=========================

Welcome to the maven-test-process-plugin for [Apache Maven 2](http://maven.apache.org).

This plugin makes it easy to run integration tests as part of your Maven build which require starting up your application as a separate command. It was originally written to support containers who's start scripts are blocking in nature, therefore preventing use of more standard pre- and post- integration test phase tasks.

Documentation can be found [here](http://betfair.github.io/maven-test-process-plugin/).
